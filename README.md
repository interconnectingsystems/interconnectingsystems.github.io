# Interconnecting systems

## What is a interconnecting system?

An interconnected system *in the workplace* is the process of linking manpower, technological resources and other items of capital together. Such a system typically improves efficiency and accountability throughout the organization.

In *telecommunications*, interconnection is the physical linking of a carrier's network with equipment or facilities not belonging to that network. The term may refer to a connection between a carrier's facilities and the equipment belonging to its customer, or to a connection between two (or more) carriers.

The single most important thing to try to understand is that all things are connected. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the place we live in our home and environment (all the plants, animals and living things around us), the energy we use, our family and friends they are all interconnected. Small changes now might have huge consequences in the future. We need to re-connect ourselves to the earth, to nature, to the systems that enable us to live.
